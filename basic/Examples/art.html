            <h2>Beyond the floating world: Japanese Prints after Ukiyo-e</h2>

            <p>Ukiyo-e roughly translates to "images of the floating world". It traditionally refers to the prints and paintings of 17th to 19th century Japan that predominantly focused
                on depicting the activities of the pleasure districts (theatre, sumo and courtesans) in Tokyo, as well as scenes from history/folklore and landscapes.
            </p>
            <p>The Ukiyo-e tradition faded towards the end of the 19th century. It successors in the early 20th were heavily influenced by
                Japans exposure to western artistic traditions. In the world of printmaking two distinct groups of print artists formed, the 
                "Creative Prints" or "Sosaku Hanga" and "New Prints" or "Shin Hanga". The creative prints made liberal use of western techniques and 
                were the predominant group of abstract print artists in the country. They departed from traditional methods of Japanese printmaking where 
                prints were produced by a group of distinct professionals - designers creating images, carvers cutting them and printers producing the 
                images enmass. Instead these creative print artists were often responsible for the whole process and thus the entirety of the output. 
                By contrast the "New" print artists actually sought to create new prints in the old ukiyoe fashion, it was an attempt to revive the 
                techniques and traditions of the past in the new era. The main distinction between the New Prints and the Ukiyo-e of the past was that 
                while the New Prints picked up on the same genres it did incorporate the western techniques and perspectives that weren't known previously.

            <p>Piet Mondriaan (1872-1944) and Theo van Doesburg (1883-1931) both born in the Netherlands co-founded De Stijl, which was originally a publication, in 1917. It was committed to 
                strictly geometrical art in black, white or primary colours.
