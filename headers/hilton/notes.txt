Based on the youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxwHXxumdQk of Marc Hilton

Interesting notes:

Uses "display:table", combined with "display:table-cell" and "vertical-align:middle"
for centering elements.

Uses floats to force position and then height 100% to break inline-block formatting

Uses padding right on the last list element to make it fit tightly to the end 
of the header bar.
